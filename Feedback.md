I don't have write privs on your repo, so I'll make a pull request for this. I swear I already reviewed this, 
but I can't find any evidence. (After reading the code, I now _know_ that I reviewed this already. Where 
the heck is my write up? Beats me.)

Your results are spot on, so consider this **complete**.

### Part 1

I have no idea why this didn't work for you. Good job figuring out a way to solve the problem. In 
many ways this is actually a good thing. Often we have a plan for doing an analysis and then that
plan doesn't work out and we need to come up with a "brute force" approach. 

### Part 2

Looks good.

### Part 3

This one also looks good. 

Nice job, way to get to the finish line.
